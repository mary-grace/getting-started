Welcome to The Evangelist Collective! Whether you identify as a community manager, developer evangelist, or somewhere in between, we're glad you're here! Here's a few things to get you started:

* Join the "General" room to meet everyone. Feel free to introduce yourself and say hi to those people you may have met elsewhere, and meet those that you haven't yet had the pleasure of getting to know. Don't worry about not being "technical enough" or feel like you have to know everyone to fit in. We're a very welcoming group, and we've got everyone from event directors to programmers in here, so we're sure you'll find someone to talk to!
* Find a city room to connect with those folks who are in your local area. Post your upcoming events, see who's around, and meet up in person to get to know the community better.
