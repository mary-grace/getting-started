Welcome to The Evangelist Collective! Whether you identify as a community manager, developer evangelist, or somewhere in between, we're glad you're here! Here are few things to get you started:

* Check out our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/evangelistcollective/getting-started/blob/master/CodeOfConduct.md).
TL;DR: 
** Be respectful.
** Abusive behavior is never tolerated.
** Data published to WADE is hosted at the discretion of the administrators, and may be removed.
** Violations of this code may result in swift and permanent expulsion from the WADE community.
** We're here to help:
Mary Thengvall: @mary_grace
Dave Josephson: @dave
Flo Motlik: @flomotlik
* Join the #general channel to meet everyone. Feel free to introduce yourself and say hi to those people you may have met elsewhere, and meet those that you haven't yet had the pleasure of getting to know. Don't worry about not being "technical enough" or feel like you have to know everyone to fit in. We're a very welcoming group, and we've got everyone from event managers to CTOs in here, so we're sure you'll find someone to talk to!
* Find a city room to connect with those folks who are in your local area, or in a city you're traveling to. Post your upcoming events, see who's around, and meet up in person to get to know the community better.
* If you're on the road as often as the rest of us are, you'll want to join the #on-the-road-again channel. You can figure out who's going to be where when, what the hot conferences are, and when you'll have a chance to meet your new internet best friend IRL.
* Lastly, make yourself at home! Check out the various channels, ask questions, share ideas, and meet new friends.
* Suggestions on how to make the group better? Visit us over at #i-hate-it-here.

See you around!
